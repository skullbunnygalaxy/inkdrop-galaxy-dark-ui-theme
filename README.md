# Galaxy Dark UI Theme for Inkdrop


Similar to my [Galaxy Syntax Theme for Inkdrop](https://github.com/skullbunnygalaxy/inkdrop-galaxy-dark-syntax-theme), this UI theme is heavily influenced by [ahmadawais's shades-of-purple-vscode theme](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode), with some adjustments to better fit my sense of style.
